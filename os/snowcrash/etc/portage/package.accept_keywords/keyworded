# Every entry here should be without a specific version. This is the

# 1. One always wants the latest tested version of the given
# ebuild. (~amd64)
#
# 2. One always wants the latest (unstested) version
# or a the given ebuild. (**) Or maybe it's a live ebuild.
#
# 3. Or less likely â€” it's impractical to manage release engineering
# for the particular ebuild due to other reasons.
#
# In a perfect world not anything would exist here, but one must
# practicalness with stability.
